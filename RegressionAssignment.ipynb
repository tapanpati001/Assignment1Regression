    "Linear regression is a statistical method used to study the relationship between a dependent variable (Y) and one or more independent variables (X). Simple linear regression involves a single independent variable, while multiple linear regression involves more than one independent variable.\n",

    "In simple linear regression, the relationship between Y and X is modeled as a straight line, and the goal is to estimate the slope and intercept of the line that best fits the data. For example, a simple linear regression could be used to study the relationship between a person's height (X) and their weight (Y), where Y is the dependent variable and X is the independent variable.\n",

    "In contrast, multiple linear regression involves modeling the relationship between a dependent variable and two or more independent variables. The goal is to estimate the coefficients for each independent variable that best predict the value of the dependent variable.

    "Linear regression is a widely used statistical technique to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. There are several assumptions that underlie the linear regression model, which need to be satisfied for the model to be valid and reliable. These assumptions include:\n",
    "\n",
    "Linearity: The relationship between the dependent variable and the independent variables is linear. This means that the change in the dependent variable is proportional to the change in the independent variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Independence: The observations in the dataset are independent of each other. This means that the value of one observation does not influence the value of another observation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Homoscedasticity: The variance of the errors is constant across all levels of the independent variables. This means that the variability in the errors is the same for all values of the independent variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Normality: The errors are normally distributed with a mean of zero. This means that the distribution of the errors follows a normal distribution, and the mean of the errors is zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "No multicollinearity: The independent variables are not highly correlated with each other. This means that there is no perfect linear relationship between the independent variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "To check whether these assumptions hold in a given dataset, there are several methods that can be used. These include:\n",
    "\n",
    "Residual plots: One way to check the assumptions of linear regression is to plot the residuals (i.e., the difference between the actual and predicted values) against the predicted values. If the assumptions are satisfied, then the residuals should be randomly distributed around zero, with no pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "Normality tests: Another way to check the assumption of normality is to perform a normality test on the residuals. One common test is the Shapiro-Wilk test, which tests whether the distribution of the residuals is significantly different from a normal distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multicollinearity tests: To check for multicollinearity, one can compute the correlation matrix between the independent variables. If there is a high correlation between any two independent variables, then this may indicate multicollinearity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Outlier detection: Outliers can affect the validity of the linear regression model. One can detect outliers by plotting the residuals against the independent variables or by using outlier detection methods such as the Cook's distance or the leverage statistic."

In batch gradient descent, we update the parameters based on the average of the gradients computed over the entire training set.

Mini-batch gradient descent is a compromise between these two, where we update the parameters based on the gradient computed for a small subset of the training set at a time.\n",
